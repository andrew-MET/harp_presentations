Timestamp,I attended...,Did you find the course useful?,How did you find the level of the coding examples?,How was the pace of the course?,"Was there anything that was a total game changer for you? (e.g. something you didn't know before, but will make your work much easier)","Was there anything that was especially bad? (e.g. really badly explained, really boring, really irrelevant) Note: we know we did some things badly so you won't be hurting anyone's feelings!)",Any other comments?

15/03/2024 08:58:31,In person,Very Useful,About right,About right,"The spatial data handling in harp was very impressive and I'll be using it much more for visualisation going forward. Also it was my first time to see conditional verification, which will be very useful for analysing performance in specific circumstances.","Not really - I think in the afternoon where the Frost example was covered, people wanted to work on their own problems anyway.",Thanks again for all your hard work and for putting the course together!
15/03/2024 11:23:31,Online,Quite Useful,A little bit difficult,About right,Apart from the novelties or improvements of harp code presented in the course I did not find any critical change for my work.,"(Not especially bad)

It was complicated to reproduce the examples at the same time they were explained (it is not only a matter of typing more slowly!). And it is interesting to do so it if you want to try some of those examples with your own files and check quickly if everything works in your case. It would help to have the examples in advance to let you make copy-paste (with make the pertinent modifications, of course).

Although I know that harp is in constant development,  in my opinion, the course should be mostly based on the stable release of harp. When using the development branches of harp it is quite uncertain whether what you learnt (and maybe put to work operationally) will remain exactly the same  in the next reference version.","I would like to acknowledge again the enormous effort you are making to develop this very useful tool. The progress made in the last year has been substantial. 

Although harp has a great potential of use, my knowledge of all harp packages (included external ones) is very limited and takes time to learn. For this reason, and in my particular case, I find it difficult to be able to do things very different from the examples you are showing  or to use harp apart from the combination script&configuration_file. 

Apart from the ""lessons"" you upload from the course, I do not know if it would be a good idea to sort out some of the examples in a kind of ""How to""  section.  To have a cheat sheet for a quick reference to the functions is another idea.

Thanks a lot!"
15/03/2024 16:42:24,In person,Very Useful,About right,About right,Getting more familiar with the visualization capabilities of harp,"It would be great if the spatial part was provided in a tidier manner. It is usually the case that the point verification and data ingestion part is prepared before hand and then the code is posted online every day. This does not happen with the spatial part, and there are always last minute developments that would be committed during the week . Also, using the development version in the course might not be the best practice in my opinion, since this version is changing and the functions might change. Would it not be better to use the current stable version instead?",It is a great idea to record the presentations and make them available online. I hope this is done in future courses as well!
17/03/2024 11:22:11,Online,Very Useful,About right,A bit fast,"The courses and training were very helpful, especially with keeping video captures as well as the tests. Even though I didn't know before that we could conduct single-day assessments, whereas previously it was a minimum of 7 days.",The only thing that wasn't online was not having access to practical exercises.,thank you for all

21/03/2024 09:09:38,In person,Very Useful,About right,A bit fast,"Spatial verification was something that I had not worked within HARP of course, so it was useful to identify ways it can easily replace some existing tools. Also, 'Build a Script' was particularly useful as I am not an R experts and the good practises discussed here were very useful.",,
21/03/2024 16:56:55,Online,Quite Useful,About right,About right,"verification paramters are handled easier nowadays, scaling of prameters too (at least the way I did it until now with quite old versions)",Not really during the lessions I attended - from remote there is always some of them when it is not possible (and actually that was bad),Managed to code the basics script for point verification for a new task at our institute during the session on point verification.

11/04/2024 13:38:17,In person,Quite Useful,About right,A bit fast,"It was great to hear about new packages, functions and methods that I wasn't aware of. One tends to use what has worked in the past - so good to ""be upgraded"". This was useful for the harp package but also in general. Alex's tricks regarding eccodes and variable names was useful. ","I gave up trying to code with Andrew and Alex, but rather used the time to follow and understand. Having everything online afterwards is great, because now I can go back through everything in the quiet of my office. ",Thanks for all your hard work.
